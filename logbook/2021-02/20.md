# Set up

This is on the System 76 Pop-OS! laptop.

## Install R

```shell
sudo apt install r-base-core
R
```

```R
install.packages("igraph")
```

It asked whether I wanted to install globally but of course that's not writable so no but then locally and I accepted the default location `~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/`.


## RStudio

But perhaps I should be installing these packages inside [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS isn't listed (Pop-OS! neither, unsurprisingly), but try the [rstudio-1.4.1103-amd64.deb](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-1.4.1103-amd64.deb) for Ubuntu 18, which was installed automatically using Eddy.

RStudio can be launched from the Pop-OS! start-button.

## R packages

Inside RStudio, on the menu bar: `Tools/Install Packages`.  I selected "igraph". This just installs into the same place as the command-line `R`.  It takes a little while as it's compiling things.

* `igraph`
* `statnet`
* `ggraph` 
* `tidygraph`
* `tidyverse`
